<h1>AFD READER</h1>

<h2>What is this project?</h2>
This project is a simple implementation of a Finite Automate using Finite-state Machine Model.

<h2>What is the purpose of this project?</h2>
This project is to learn how to use the C++ language by building a simple console application.

<h2>How to use this project?</h2>
This project's original main goal is to create a static library wich includes a full AFD implementation.
So you can use this library to implement your own Finite Automate by including the header file and reading from a text file respecting the FA defining protocol. <br>
The header file is located in the AFD_cpp\AFD\AFD.hpp file.<br>
The main file is an example of how to use the library.

<h2>What's the future of this project?</h2>
This project is a work in progress.
Soon i might add a GUI that shows the input analyzer doing its magic to this project, and also AFD to AFD manilpulation.
