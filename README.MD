# DFA/AFD implementation

## What is this project?

This project is a simple implementation of a Finite Automate using Finite-state Machine Model.
It is a simple library mainly to read a DFA file from a text file or .afd file and load it into memory as an afd object to avoid repetitive operations within a code base.
Within the afd class are methods that permits the mamnipulation of the DFA.
The code is very easy to read and understand, use and quite performant although not generic.
